## Current Status

Your app is currently using the **free fallback AI** which is working perfectly! You don't need to spend any money to use the app. The fallback AI provides good, culturally-appropriate responses for Sierra Leone users.

If you want to try OpenAI later for better responses, the $5 free credit is usually enough to test it out, and then it's only ~$0.50-2/month which is very affordable.
